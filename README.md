# Component Libraries

This respository is meant to provide a thorough and deep selection of parts for Autodesk EAGLE ECAD software. The documentation method for these libraries focus on embedded all of the ordering and sourcing information directly into the components themselves. This limits the ability to quickly change the value of a resistor or a capacitor but allows for hands-off and accurate BOM generation.
